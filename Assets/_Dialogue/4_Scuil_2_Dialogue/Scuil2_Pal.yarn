Darren@In this scene you will start wi having a chat wi yer pal sitting behind you. On the wall behind this character will be a colourful Burns Night poster. The teacher will tell ye off for being chatty. You will have the option to give cheek back in English or Scots. If you choose the Scots option the teacher will get more annoyed with you and pull you aside and punish you. The scene will then progress and the teacher will talk about the upcoming Burns Night - she'll hand out Burns poems that the class need to learn. The player will see that the poems are written in Scots, and then the scene will end. #line:0cbbb8b
